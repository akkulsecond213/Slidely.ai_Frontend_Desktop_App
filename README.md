## Description
The application features two main functionalities accessible through buttons on a Form:
-   **View Submissions**: Clicking this button opens a form dedicated to browsing through existing submissions. The View Submissions Form includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through submitted entries. By default, the form displays the details of the first submission upon opening.
  -   **Delete Submission**: Provides an option to delete the current submission entry.
      
  -   **Edit Submission**: Allows users to modify the details of the current viewed submission using the editable fields.
    
-   **Create New Submission**: Clicking this button opens a form designed for creating new submissions. The form includes editable fields for Name, Email, Phone Number, and a GitHub repository link. It also features a stopwatch that can be paused and resumed without resetting from 0.
